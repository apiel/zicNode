# rtaudio: 

Download debian version instead of github (https://github.com/thestk/rtaudio)

(5.2.0~ds1)

`git clone https://salsa.debian.org/multimedia-team/rtaudio.git`


# rtmidi:

5.0.0

https://github.com/thestk/rtmidi

# libsndfile

For the moment don't manage to include it directly in the project, therefor need to install
libsndfile. Maybe should use another library? Or keep it as it is...

1.2.0
https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile
